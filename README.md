# LycheePy

Lychee is a distributed, easy to scale, processing server of geo-spatial information.

It allows you to: 
 * Publish pre-defined processing chains through a WPS interface. By doing so, users
 are abstracted about the chains complexity, because they do not have to build them 
 each time they want to chain processes. From the consumer users perspective, a 
 chain is just another process.
 * Automatize geo-spatial data publication through repositories, such as GeoServer, 
 FTP servers, or any other kind of repository.
 * Easily scale. LycheePy is a distributed system. Worker nodes are the ones which 
 provide the processing capabilities and execute processes, and you can add or remove 
 as many you require. Also, LycheePy will concurrently execute processes when it is 
 applicable to the chain's topology.
